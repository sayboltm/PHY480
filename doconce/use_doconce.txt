doconce is magic, go to https://github.com/hplgit/doconce and download. My good friend Hans Petter Langtangen (passed away last October) developed this.

In the phy480 github folder, go to for example https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/tree/master/doc/src/mcint

or any of the folders under /src

There you find the source file

mcint.do.txt   Look at it and see how simple it  is. The file make.sh does the various jobs for,

just run as

bash make.sh mcint   (don't add .do.txt)   and it generates ipynb, various types of html, pdf, latex, you name and you've got it.

If just want say a simple html run as

doconce format html mcint

or an ipynb run as

doconce format ipynb mcint


If you need to transform a latex file just do

doconce latex2doconce file.tex >  new file
