f(x) = x/(x+1)

x:
0 = 0
small = small
1 = 0.5
big = almost 1


np.abs((mi-mj)/m0)**-a returns:
1 no matter what for a=0

small pos for big difference, a=1
huge for small difference, a=1, even more huge for a=2
, will never be zero, but could be infinity if mi==mj, which is problem


so make formula:
(x/(x+1))**-a

np.abs((mi-mj)/m0)

((np.abs((mi-mj)/m0))/(np.abs((mi-mj)/m0) + 1))**-a
