# Readme

./Source/: Contains source code
	- Project4_finance2.1.py: The final version capable of modeling all
	  features covered
	- LibFinance.py: A library of commonly used functions in this project
	- quikplot_experimental.py: A plotting program to crudely generate
	  variables from previously exported text files to recreate the model
	  generated by some experiment
	- quikplot_exp2.py: Another variation of quikplot to iterate through
	  many datasets and plot them on top of each other.
		Note: Beware of folder names with '.' in them when trying to
		eval(). This must be another reason why this method is 
		dangerous and should not be used

./Report: Contains project report 

Other dirs and files:
	../../Plottr.py: Shared pyplot 'wrapper' used for convenience here and
	in past research and coursework

	../../PHY480tmp: Directory of a bunch of stuff hastly copied over from
	crude parallelization on engineering servers. not sure if should delete
	because many code in the Source folder points to it.
