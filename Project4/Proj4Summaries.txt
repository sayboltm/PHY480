PHY 480 Project 4 Notes

Quantum Monte carlo
- stochastic methods instead of eigs (proj2)


Molecular dynamics (proj3, gforce instead with [something] potential)
- uses QT creator

Financial Engineering
- from statistical physics
- pareto front

Ising model and statistical physics
- phase transitions
- cool physics stuff
ref: statphys-beamer.pdf

White dwarf star
- solve diffeq
- gravitational forces vs pressure from collapse
- how the sun fails
- the simplest/use rk4
