With
\[
\tilde{h}=h\left(\frac{\xi}{\epsilon}\right)^{1+1/M}.
\]
we can design the following algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
 \item If the two answers are close, keep the approximation to $h$.

 \item If $\epsilon > \xi$ we need to decrease the step size in the next time step.

 \item If $\epsilon < \xi$ we need to increase the step size in the next time step.
\end{itemize}
