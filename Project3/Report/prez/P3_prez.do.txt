===== Introduction =====
!bblock
* For ease of debugging, a simulation of a simple binary system is created first

The only force in the problem is gravity. Newton's law of gravitation  is given by a force $F_G$
\[
F_G=\frac{GM_{\odot}M_{\mathrm{Earth}}}{r^2},
\]
where $M_{\odot}$ is the mass of the Sun and $M_{\mathrm{Earth}}$ is the mass of the Earth. The gravitational constant is $G$ and $r$ is the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
